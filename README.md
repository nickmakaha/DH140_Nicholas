## Notes

* There are many guides out there on how to use markdown syntax.  The following is one example you may find useful:
  * [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* In this assignment notebook, you will find that you are unable to alter the content of the cells that I have written -> this is on purpose.  However, you will be able to edit and run all response cells.
* After writing your responses in markdown, execute the cells so that your markdown text gets rendered.
<div class="alert alert-info">

<b>Initial step:</b>

Open the cell below in edit mode (by double-clicking on it), look at how it is written, and then run it.  Make sure you understand how the text is marked up to get the header style, italics, bold, and a bulleted list.

# First example

This is one example of a *cell* that is written using **markdown** syntax.

It uses:
* '#' for a header
* '*' for italics
* '**' for bold
<div class="alert alert-info">

<b>Personal Profile:</b>

Use markdown in the cell below to write a personal profile.  
    
This should include:
1. your name, styled as an H1 header (see for example the above cheatsheet)
2. your major in bold font
3. your year in school in italics
4. a description of why you are interested in the course, in normal font.

**Computer Science & Engineering**

*Senior*

I am interesting in learning how coding can apply to the humanities realm and seeing how the technical and humanitarian fields can intersect.

**Data and viz of interest**

1. Find a journal or newspaper article that relates data science to a humanities topic that you are interested in.
  * Add a hypertext link to the article in the next cell and comment on why it interests you.
2. Find a data visualization that you would love to know how to make with Python
  * Include the image in the next cell too and comment on why you like it.
[Data Science and the Humanities: A Mutually Beneficial Relationship](https://devoelmoorecenter.com/2020/11/08/data-science-and-the-humanities-a-mutually-beneficial-relationship/)

This article serves as a good introduction into the crossing of technical and humanitarian focused individuals - it brings up interesting statistics and mentions the rise of non-technical individuals in STEM fields.

Principal Components Analysis is a very useful statistical tool, and making 3D PCA plots would be a nice skill to learn.

<b>Ideas for data to investigate</b>

In the cell below:
1. Write a bulleted list of 2 or 3 humanities topics of interest to you.
2. Do a quick search for data and/or articles related to those topics, and write a numbered list of links to your search results.

<b>Ideas from curated datasets & project lists</b>

Review the projects and datasets on the following two pages:
* https://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w21/final-project/datasets
* https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets

Make a table in the cell below that includes columns for (1) the name of any dataset of interest, (2) a brief description of the data and how you think coding might be useful to investigate the dataset, and (3) a hypertext link to the data.
    
There is no restriction on number of datasets to include, but please include at least two.
Name | Description | Hypertext Link
--- | --- | ---
Sources of income, and expenditures, for college athletics | The data shoes where money is coming from and where it is going in college athletics. Coding could be useful for examining this dataset as trends could quickly be found - you could examine the top revenue sources very quickly and the top destinations for where the money ends up. | [College Athletics Revenue/Expenditure Data](https://knightnewhousedata.org/)
 Nixon White House Recordings | The data includes sound recordings of Nixon's telephone calls recorded at both the white house and the Camp David retreat. Coding could be useful for this dataset as it could be run through a speech->text converter, and then the text could be analyzed for sentiments, intentions, etc... It'd provide some synopsis into Nixon's conversations much quicker than a human listening to the audio recordings. | [Nixon Tapes](https://www.archives.gov/open/nixon/37-wht-dataset-conversationlist.html)
