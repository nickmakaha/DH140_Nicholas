**Data and viz of interest**

[Data Science and the Humanities: A Mutually Beneficial Relationship](https://devoelmoorecenter.com/2020/11/08/data-science-and-the-humanities-a-mutually-beneficial-relationship/)

This article serves as a good introduction into the crossing of technical and humanitarian focused individuals - it brings up interesting statistics and mentions the rise of non-technical individuals in STEM fields.

Principal Components Analysis is a very useful statistical tool, and making 3D PCA plots would be a nice skill to learn.

<b>Ideas from curated datasets & project lists</b>

Review the projects and datasets on the following two pages:
* https://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w21/final-project/datasets
* https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets

Make a table in the cell below that includes columns for (1) the name of any dataset of interest, (2) a brief description of the data and how you think coding might be useful to investigate the dataset, and (3) a hypertext link to the data.
    
There is no restriction on number of datasets to include, but please include at least two.
Name | Description | Hypertext Link
--- | --- | ---
Sources of income, and expenditures, for college athletics | The data shoes where money is coming from and where it is going in college athletics. Coding could be useful for examining this dataset as trends could quickly be found - you could examine the top revenue sources very quickly and the top destinations for where the money ends up. | [College Athletics Revenue/Expenditure Data](https://knightnewhousedata.org/)
 Nixon White House Recordings | The data includes sound recordings of Nixon's telephone calls recorded at both the white house and the Camp David retreat. Coding could be useful for this dataset as it could be run through a speech->text converter, and then the text could be analyzed for sentiments, intentions, etc... It'd provide some synopsis into Nixon's conversations much quicker than a human listening to the audio recordings. | [Nixon Tapes](https://www.archives.gov/open/nixon/37-wht-dataset-conversationlist.html)
